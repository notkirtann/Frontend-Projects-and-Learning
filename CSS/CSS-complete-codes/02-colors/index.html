      <h1>My Web Development Journey</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Welcome to a space where I share my growth in modern web development.
        I enjoy exploring different areas of coding—from frontend styling and
        responsive design to building efficient server-side logic and APIs.
        Over time, I have worked on projects like e-commerce applications,
        real-time communication tools, portfolios, and utility-based apps.
        Each project helps me understand UI/UX, performance optimization,
        clean architecture, and real problem-solving techniques.
        I believe in continuous learning, experimenting with new technologies,
        and writing code that is readable, secure, and scalable.
