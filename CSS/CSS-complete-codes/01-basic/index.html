    <h1>Welcome to My Web Development Journey</h1>

    <p class="para">
      I am Kirtan Nahar, a MERN and Backend Developer dedicated to building
      scalable APIs, secure authentication systems, and full-stack applications.
      My journey includes mastering JavaScript (ES6+), Node.js, Express, MongoDB,
      and modern tools like JWT, Cloudinary, Nodemailer, and Mongoose.
      I have built real projects such as an e-commerce platform, chat
      application, portfolio website, task manager API, and more—each helping me
      understand real-world development challenges.  
      I continue learning, improving, and creating meaningful projects that
      showcase clean code, performance optimization, and practical development
      skills.
